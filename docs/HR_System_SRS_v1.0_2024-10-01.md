## **2. Overall Description**

### **2.1 Product Perspective**

The Recruitment Process and Resume Management System is an independent, cloud-native application designed to streamline the hiring processes within enterprises. The system leverages AWS services and is intended to be deployed in the user's own AWS account, allowing for customization and configuration specific to each organization's needs.

### **2.2 Product Functions**

The system provides the following key functions:

- **Job Posting Management**: Create, edit, publish, and close job postings.
- **Online Application and Resume Submission**: Candidates can search for jobs and submit applications with resumes.
- **Resume Management**: Secure storage, retrieval, and management of resumes.
- **Resume Parsing (AI Integration)**: Automatic extraction of key information from resumes to create candidate profiles.
- **Candidate Tracking and Workflow Management**: Track candidate status throughout the recruitment process with customizable workflows.
- **Communication and Notifications**: Send emails and notifications to candidates and recruiters.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate reports on recruitment metrics.
- **Configuration Management**: Allow HR to configure recruitment processes and system settings.

### **2.3 User Classes and Characteristics**

- **Recruiters/Human Resources**
  - Responsibilities: Manage job postings, review applications, track candidates, configure workflows.
  - Skills: Familiarity with recruitment processes, basic computer skills.
- **Hiring Managers**
  - Responsibilities: Evaluate candidates, provide feedback, make hiring decisions.
  - Skills: Expertise in their respective domains, basic computer skills.
- **Candidates**
  - Responsibilities: Search and apply for jobs, submit resumes, communicate with recruiters.
  - Skills: Varies widely; assume basic internet usage skills.
- **System Administrators**
  - Responsibilities: Manage system deployment, configurations, and maintenance.
  - Skills: Knowledge of AWS services, system administration, and deployment tools.

### **2.4 Operating Environment**

- **Frontend Application**
  - Developed using Next.js (React framework).
  - Accessible via modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Backend Services**
  - Implemented using AWS Lambda functions with Node.js.
  - APIs exposed via Amazon API Gateway.
- **Data Storage**
  - Structured Data: Amazon DynamoDB.
  - Object Storage: Amazon S3 for resumes and files.
- **Deployment**
  - Users deploy the system in their own AWS accounts using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK.
- **Testing**
  - Jest is used for unit testing, should be automated and run on every code commit configured in the CI/CD pipeline. The test coverage should be at least 80% for all critical code.
- **Development Environment**
  - Codebase managed using standard code editors (e.g., VS Code) and version control systems (e.g., Git).

### **2.5 Detailed System Architecture**

- **Frontend**

  - Next.js: Provides a modern user interface that allows job seekers to apply for jobs and HR personnel to manage job postings and candidates.
  - React Context API & Redux: Manages application state.
  - Tailwind CSS: Provides a utility-first CSS framework for styling.
  - Axios: Handles API requests.

  The frontend will handle all user interactions, such as displaying job postings, collecting candidate information, and providing HR dashboards. It will connect with backend services through REST APIs.

- **Backend**

  - Node.js: Runtime environment for AWS Lambda functions.
  - AWS Lambda: Executes backend logic.
  - Amazon API Gateway: Exposes RESTful APIs.

  The backend business logic is implemented using AWS Lambda, where each Lambda function corresponds to a specific service (e.g., job posting management, resume parsing). The functions are triggered by HTTP requests via AWS API Gateway.

- **API Gateway**

  - AWS API Gateway

  The API Gateway acts as a middleman between the frontend and backend, defining different endpoints like /jobs, /apply, etc. It securely manages incoming requests and triggers the appropriate Lambda function.

- **Database**

  - Amazon DynamoDB

  DynamoDB is used for its scalability and ease of integration with Lambda functions. The schema includes tables such as:

  - JobPostings: Stores details of available job positions.
  - Candidates: Stores candidate information and resume metadata.
  - Applications: Tracks each job application and its status.

- **Authentication & Authorization**

  - AWS Cognito

  Cognito manages different user roles:

  - HR users: Can manage job postings, review applications, and configure workflows.
  - Hiring Managers: Can evaluate candidates, provide feedback, and make hiring decisions.
  - Candidates: Can search for jobs, submit applications, and communicate with recruiters.
  - System Administrators: Can manage system deployment, configurations, and maintenance.

- **Storage**

  - Amazon S3

  S3 is used for secure storage of resumes, cover letters, and other files. It provides high-performance, scalable, and durable object storage. Resumes are uploaded directly by candidates and linked to candidate records in DynamoDB.

- **Resume Parsing**

  - Amazon Textract
  - Amazon Comprehend

  Textract and Comprehend are used to automatically extract key information from resumes. Textract is used for text-based documents, while Comprehend is used for natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis and entity recognition. When a resume is uploaded, AWS Textract extracts relevant text, and AWS Comprehend is used to identify key entities (such as skills, experience, education) to enrich the candidate profile.

- **Notifications**

  - Amazon SES

  Sends email notifications to candidates (e.g., application receipt) and HR users (e.g., new applications).

- **Infrastructure as Code**

  - AWS CDK

  Infrastructure resources such as Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, S3, Cognito, and SES are defined using AWS CDK to enable consistent, repeatable deployments.

- **Logging & Monitoring**

  - AWS CloudWatch

  All Lambda function logs are directed to CloudWatch for debugging and monitoring purposes. Alarms can be set up to detect anomalies, such as increased error rates.

- **Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline**

  - Jenkins

  Jenkins is used to automate the deployment process. It triggers builds and deployments based on code changes.

- **Testing**

  - Jest

  Jest is used for unit testing, should be automated and run on every code commit configured in the CI/CD pipeline. The test coverage should be at least 80% for all critical code.

### **2.6 Design and Implementation Constraints**

- **AWS Dependency**: The system relies on AWS services and requires an AWS account for deployment.
- **Customization**: Users must be able to configure the system to suit their specific recruitment workflows.
- **Security Compliance**: Must adhere to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- **Scalability**: System should scale automatically based on usage.
- **Resource Limits**: Must operate within AWS service limits; users may need to request limit increases.

### **2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies**

- Users have an AWS account with necessary permissions.
- Users have basic knowledge of AWS services or will follow provided deployment guides.
- Candidates and recruiters have access to the internet and modern web browsers.
- Resumes are submitted in supported file formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
- AWS services used are available and operational in the user's chosen region.
